=========================================

This document grants an additional permission under Section 7 of the GNU Affero
General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0-only) for the VDO.Ninja SDK.

This exception applies only to the following files (the "Covered SDK Files"):

- vdoninja-sdk.js
- vdoninja-sdk.min.js

2. Official Distributions
-------------------------
An "Official Distribution" of a Covered SDK File means a copy of that file that
is distributed by Steve Seguin as part of:

- the npm package @vdoninja/sdk@X.Y.Z (a specific published version), and/or
- a tagged release vX.Y.Z of the GitHub repository https://github.com/steveseguin/ninjasdk

"Unmodified" means byte-for-byte identical to an Official Distribution of the
same Covered SDK File, including preservation of any license notices.

4. Additional Permission

Notwithstanding the other terms of the AGPL-3.0-only, you are granted permission
to use, copy, combine, bundle, link, and convey the Covered SDK Files in
Unmodified form as part of a larger work (a "Larger Work"), and to convey that
Larger Work under terms of your choice (including proprietary terms), without
requiring that the Larger Work as a whole be licensed under the AGPL.

5. Conditions
-------------
This additional permission applies only if:

- the Covered SDK Files are Unmodified; and
- you comply with the AGPL-3.0-only requirements applicable to conveying verbatim
  copies of the Covered SDK Files (including preserving notices and providing
  recipients a copy of the AGPL license).

6. Modified Versions

If you modify any Covered SDK File, this additional permission does not apply to
that modified file or to any Larger Work that includes that modified file.

This exception grants no rights beyond those stated above.
